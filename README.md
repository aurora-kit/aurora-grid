You can also install through `npm i aurora-grid`

#### Custom Build
Aurora Grid was created using [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) . It includes some settings and mixins to control and create custom builds for advanced needs.
For an easy to use development process you just have to install the `npm` packages and start editing, building and exporting your custom `aurora-grid.css` file. From the Terminal App, in the path where you have the Aurora Grid folder, you can run:

    npm install

Now you have all the development dependencies installed in your `node_modules` folder.

We use Gulp as a task runner. Make sure you have it installed globally or just `npm install gulp -g`. Now you are ready to create a custom build of your project or watch it when working on it. Just run one of the two commands on the Terminal:

    gulp

or

    gulp watch

The `scss` files are in `/src` folder. And your output files will be available on the `/dist` folder.
